        "description": "This was a fun project, because it combined two of my favourite topics: computation and physics. I was explored applications of the finite element method, and used it to calculate static operating curves for a diode. In the future, I will be trying to expand my simulation to calculate diode switching losses at different frequencies.",

I used Material UI for the basic UI elements, and since I can't draw, I used ChatGPT to generate several of the icons.",
