While the primary application focuses on automated bin-picking, the company also has applications for camera inspection, and robotic guidance. As a co-op, I had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, including a deep learning pipleline and a point cloud alignment algorithm. I was hired back as a part-time developer, tasked with designing and implementing the robotic guidance application. As the project grew, I took on more responsibility, managing a team of five and ensuring that deliverables were met. After graduation I signed a full-time contract with the company to continue my work as a team lead. Since that project ended, I have designed and developed two further customer-facing applications.",

They have operations that span the entire range of activities in the fertilizer sectorâ€”including the mining of potash, which is used as a fertilizer additive. I worked in the mining department, where the company had decided to explore migrating their operations to a tele-remote system. This would allow operators to control the borers from an office above ground, not only reducing health risks to the operators, but also significantly improving the mine's uptime. When I joined, the automation project was still in its beginning stages. I was tasked with exploring different technologies to determine how the operators above ground could gain visibility into the mine environment underground. Using LiDAR sensors, ROS, and several other open source libraries, I built software prototypes that gave the management team insight into the feasibility of tele-remote borer control.",
